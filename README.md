The challenge has three tracks:
- :dart: [Pedestrian Intent Prediction (PIP)](https://github.com/PSI-Intention2022/PSI-Intent-Prediction.git)
- :dart: [Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction (PTP)](https://github.com/PSI-Intention2022/PSI-Trajectory-Prediction.git)
- :dart: [Driver Decision Prediction (DDP)](https://github.com/PSI-Intention2022/PSI-DriverDecision-Prediction.git)

The challenge is based on the [Pedestrian Situated Intent (PSI) 2.0](https://github.com/PSI-Intention2022/PSI-Dataset.git) dataset.

## 1. Overview
Pedestrian behavior prediction poses a significant challenge for fully automated driving in urban environments, as it necessitates safe and efficient interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians within dynamic and diverse surroundings. Ensuring the safety of pedestrians and autonomous vehicles alike relies heavily on accurate and reliable pedestrian behavior prediction.

## 2. Challenge Tracks

:dart:***Track 1 (Pedestrian Intent Prediction (PIP)):***  to predict the intention of a pedestrian crossing a street, such as whether they intend to cross or stop.

:dart:***Track 2 (Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction (PTP)):*** to predict the future trajectory of the pedestrian, given the pedestrian’s current position and intention.

:dart:***Track 3 (Driver Decision Prediction (DDP)):*** to predict the decision of the autonomous vehicle, given the pedestrian's intent and trajectory, to ensure safe and efficient interactions.

## 3. Qualification
We warmly invite participants from across the globe to join our competition. The primary participant must be a student, either at the graduate or undergraduate level. Each team is allowed to participate in multiple tracks. For further information, please visit the website provided below.


## 4. Prizes :trophy:

## 6. Dataset - Pedestrian Situated Intent (PSI) 2.0

- Download and Prepare Dataset: Please follow [[Github](https://github.com/PSI-Intention2022/PSI-Dataset.git)] to prepare the PSI 2.0 dataset.
  - Training set: ready :white_check_mark: :smile:
  - Validation set: ready :white_check_mark: :smile:
  - Test set: (coming soon)

- Data Splits: The PSI 2.0 dataset is splitted into Train/Val/Test split as [./splits/PSI2_split.txt](./splits/PSI2_split.json).

## 7. Baselines 
To facilitate a quick start, we offer baselines for all challenge tracks, which serve as hints on utilizing the PSI 2.0 dataset effectively.

***Track 1 ([Pedestrian Intent Prediction (PIP)](https://github.com/PSI-Intention2022/PSI-Intent-Prediction.git))***: after observing 15 frames, equivalent to a duration of 0.5 seconds, the objective is to predict the intention of the target pedestrian crossing the road in front of the moving vehicle as either "Not Cross" or "Cross".

***Track 2 ([Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction (PTP)](https://github.com/PSI-Intention2022/PSI-Trajectory-Prediction.git))***: after observing 15 frames, which corresponds to a duration of 0.5 seconds, the task is to predict the trajectory of the target pedestrian for the subsequent time intervals of 0.5 seconds (15 frames), 1.0 second (30 frames), and 1.5 seconds (45 frames).

***Track 3 ([Driver Decision Prediction (DDP)](https://github.com/PSI-Intention2022/PSI-DriverDecision-Prediction.git))***: after observing 15 frames, encompassing a duration of 0.5 seconds, the goal is to predict the driving decision made by the driver. The prediction should consist of two outputs: **Speed** (options: 'increaseSpeed', 'decreaseSpeed', 'maintainSpeed') and **Direction** (options: 'goStraight', 'turnLeft', 'turnRight').



## 8.Evaluation :bellhop_bell:

### Evaluation Metrics
| Challenge Track | Reported Metrics | Ranking Metric | Ranking |
| - | :- | :-: | :-: |
|***Track 1 (Pedestrian Intent Prediction (PIP))***| F1, Recall, Precision | $F1$ | $\uparrow$|
|***Track 2 (Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction (PTP))***| ADE@1.5s <br> FDE@1.5s | $ADE@1.5s$| $\downarrow$|
|***Track 3 (Driver Decision Prediction (DDP))***| speed: Acc, mAcc <br> direction: Acc, mAcc | $\frac{(mAcc_{speed} + mAcc_{direction})}{2}$| $\uparrow$|

### Evaluation Scripts

***Track 1 (Pedestrian Intent):*** The evaluation ranking score is determined based on the F1-score of the binary intention prediction.
```python
cd ./evaluation_scripts/intention
python evaluate_results.py
```

***Track 2 (Pedestrian Trajectory):*** The evaluation ranking score for the competition is calculated as the average Average Displacement Error (ADE) of the predicted trajectory over a future time span of ***1.5*** seconds.
```python
cd ./evaluation_scripts/trajectory
python evaluate_results.py
```

***Track 3 (Driver Decision):*** The evaluation ranking score is computed as the average of the mean accuracy of both the speed and direction predictions.
```python
cd ./evaluation_scripts/driving_decision
python evaluate_results.py
```
